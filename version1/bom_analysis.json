  "reasoning": "The PCB contains a mix of components including capacitors, resistors, IC chips, and connectors, indicating a mixed signal design. The presence of IC chips and connectors suggests a moderate level of complexity. The cost estimate is based on average Indian market prices for these components and a moderate assembly cost.",
